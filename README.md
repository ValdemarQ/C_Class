# C_Class


## **SPRINT 1**

## Intro to Machine Learning | Kaggle | 1 - 5 Modules
- Decision trees - simple explanation how they work (House value predicted decisions tree, based on questions, rooms more than 2?, then this price)
- Importance to familiarise with data using Pandas, as data may be old, missing values,
thus model would not perform well given inacurate, old data on new examples.
- Building DecisionTree model with Scklearn to predict price based on selected features: Rooms, Bathrooms, Long,Lat
- Using Decision tree model to build ML predicting prices of Iowa house prices
- Feature selection & Prediction selection - explaninig how to select features and prediction target
- Model traininig - explaninig how to train model


## ML FAST.AI - LESSON 1

- Sckitlean library is most impornat and popular ML library in python
- Kaggle is great source to learn with competitions
- It's always important to look into your data and understand it
- Regresson - to predict continous data , Classifier - to predict categorical variables
- Regression - is ML model tryign to predict continuous outcome/variable
- Datetime contains a lot of information, good source for Feature engineering, dependent on your target
- Ordered some categorical ordinal data
- No harm in adding extra columns to your dataset (So go ahead)
- Feather - some light and fast way of loading,saving data
- Some great Fastai premade structures (def proc_dc, numeralize, fix_missing etc) - He used datas well, worked with missing values etc., and
got really great results, well at least - 25%



## Machine Learning with Python - Coursera
- ML =  Ability to learn without explicitly programmed.
- Basics of ML, Attributes, features, prediction target etc.
- Supervised and Unsupervised ML 
- What is classification - to predict class
- Regression is to predict continuous data



## **SPRINT 2**

## Kaggle: Intro to Machine Learning - Model Validation - Underfitting and Overfitting

Model Validation - How good is your mode? 

One of the possible metrics is Mean Absolute Error.

It's important to validate data that model has not seen before.

Train_test_split, used to break up the data into two pieces (Train and Test)

Building simple model to predict house prices with Decision Trees, training & validating
